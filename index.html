    <h2>About India</h2>
    <p>
      India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic
      variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round
      socio-economic progress since its Independence. India has become
      self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top
      industrialised countries in the world and one of the few nations to have
      gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It
      covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km (1,269,346 sq mi), extending from the
      snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south.

      As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest
      of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the
      country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in
      the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off
      into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east.
